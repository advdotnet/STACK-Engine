Actor Sample Game 
=================
### Skeletal and sprite animations

This sample demonstrates both skeletal animations using Spine as well 
as regular sprite animations. The mouse serves as a light source which 
is used for character lightning. Clicking on the screen makes both actors 
walk to the target location.
